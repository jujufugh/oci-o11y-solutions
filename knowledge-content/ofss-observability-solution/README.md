<b><h3>High level Components:</b></h3>

OCI
•	Compute Instances
•	VCN
•	Load Balancers
•	Object Storage
•	Bastion
Database
•	Oracle DB / Exadata
Application
•	Weblogic
•	OHS

<b><h3>OCI O&M Application Performance Monitoring</b></h3>
OCI Application Performance Monitoring (APM) helps to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the performance of applications especially distributed, cloud-native, or hybrid applications. APM provides end-to-end visibility into application performance using Open Telemetry based standards. 

•	Track requests across multiple application services and components.
•	Visualizes call chains to identify slow spans and bottlenecks.
•	Captures real-time performance data from browser or mobile users with Real User Monitoring
•	Simulates user traffic from different geographic locations with Availability Monitoring
•	Helps to identify availability or latency issues before users are impacted
•	Automatically generates a visual map of services and their dependencies.

<b><h3>OCI O&M Database Management </b></h3>
OCI Database Management (DBM) simplifies the management of databases through a unified interface. Its offers comprehensive views of the database activity and performance, including:

•	SQL and user session performance
•	Execution statistics
•	Blocking sessions
•	Historical SQL monitoring reports

DBM provides insights into database performance, enabling customers to proactively address issues and maintain high availability and efficiency. This makes DBM a natural extension for triaging database-related performance issues identified in APM.

<br>
<b><h3>OCI O&M Logging Analytics</b></h3>
OCI Logging Analytics can be integrated with Oracle Fusion Applications (like ERP, HCM, SCM) to provide advanced log analysis, anomaly detection, and operational visibility. This is especially useful for diagnosing performance, integration issues, and custom extensions within Fusion environments. This feature enables and helps in 

•	Faster Troubleshooting and Root Cause Analysis
•	Intelligent Log Analytics with Machine Learning
•	Improved Performance Visibility
•	Better Security and Audit Compliance
•	Correlation Across Services
•	Real-Time Search and Visualization
•	Custom Dashboards and Reports
•	Proactive Monitoring and Alerting

<br>
<b><h3>OCI O&M Stack Monitoring</b></h3>

OCI Stack Monitoring helps monitor the entire application and infrastructure stack—from applications to databases and servers—across on-premises, Oracle Cloud, and third-party environments. It enables proactive monitoring and management by collecting key metrics, allowing users to:

•	Maintain the availability and performance of Web servers, WebLogic, compute instances, and databases
•	Get a better understanding of resource utilization and dependency
•	Proactively detect anomalies and troubleshoot problems
•	Customize metrics for any resource
•	Detecting anomalies and thresholds in real-time.
•	Export metrics from opensource based tools like Promotheus, telegraf and collectd

<br>
<b><h3>OCI O&M Ops Insights</b></h3>
OCI Operations Insights (Ops Insights) is a service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure that provides AI-driven observability and capacity planning for databases, hosts, and enterprise applications. It helps to:
•	Analyze resource usage of databases/hosts across the enterprise
•	Forecast future demand for resources based on historical trends
•	Compare SQL Performance across databases and identify common patterns
•	Identify SQL performance trends across enterprise-wide databases
•	Analyze AWR statistics for database performance, diagnostics, and tuning across a fleet of databases
•	Create and receive weekly News Reports giving you breakdowns of new utilization highs, big utilization changes and inventory changes across your fleet of databases, hosts, and Exadata systems.
